# Dashboard-Olympic-Games

This repo stores the final project of the Data Analytics course in Coderhouse, which me and my team decided to be about the Olympics.

The Power BI dashboard is made up of three tabs that study the second largest sports event from its beginnings in the turn of the 20th century to present day in three kwy areas:
  1. Games (Juegos, tab 1). An overview of the games' evolution in the past century, biggest winners and hosts
  2. Sports (Disciplinas, tab 2). A one-step-closer look on the events but focusing on sports and competition.
  3. Gender (GÃ©nero, tab 3). An analysis on the best female athletes, the olympic gender gap and how female disciplines have recovered ground.
